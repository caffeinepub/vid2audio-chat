  "summary": "The diff implements the requested chat-style UI, in-browser conversion to MP3/WAV (with progress/error handling), URL validation + fetch-with-CORS fallback messaging, and an in-session job history rendered in the chat thread with status/timestamps and download metadata. One notable extra is adding an empty backend actor even though the feature is client-side.",

      "description": "Added an empty Motoko backend actor even though backend changes were not required for the requested client-side conversion feature.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest states the backend should remain a single Motoko actor and only add backend work if required; the frontend conversion is implemented client-side, and no backend methods are used/needed based on the diff.",
