  "summary": "The diff implements best-effort URL fetching with redirect following and tolerant blob/video validation, adds more specific English URL error messages, and hardens the client-side MP3 encoding pipeline to avoid uncaught exceptions and ensure jobs end in Done/Failed. However, the diff also appears to include unrelated UI/theme/config additions not requested by REQ-6/7/8.",
